✅ What is Microservice Architecture?
A design pattern that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled, independently deployable services.

Each service focuses on a single business capability.

Services communicate over lightweight protocols like HTTP or messaging queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)

✅ Why Microservice Architecture?
Scalability: Individual components can scale independently.

Flexibility: Enables tech stack diversity across services.

Resilience: Failure in one service doesn’t take down the whole system.

✅ Microservice Main Components
API Gateway: Entry point for clients, routing requests to appropriate services.

Service Registry: Tracks available services and their locations.

Configuration Server: Centralized config management.

Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across service instances.

Monitoring/Tracing Tools: Helps with observability and debugging.

🐳 What is Docker?
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

It uses OS-level virtualization to run multiple isolated applications on a single host.

📄 What is a Dockerfile?
A text file containing step-by-step instructions to build a Docker image.

📦 What is a Docker Image?

Acts like a snapshot of an environment that can be used to spin up containers.

🚢 What is a Docker Container?
A runtime instance of a Docker image.

It’s a running process that is isolated from the host but uses shared resources.

🆚 Docker vs Virtual Machine (VM)
docker- no gues OS, just isolated namespace/process, share's host kernel
